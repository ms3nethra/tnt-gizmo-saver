# TNT Gizmo Saver Documentation

## Description of the Project  
The **TNT Gizmo Saver** is a Python-based tool for Nuke that streamlines the creation of Gizmo nodes by automating key processes such as naming, version control, and metadata entry. It ensures consistent naming formats, enables efficient version tracking, and offers options for saving incremental updates. The tool is designed to enhance workflow efficiency and maintain standardized practices in asset management.

## Goal of the Project  
The primary goal of the **TNT Gizmo Saver** is to automate and standardize the process of creating and saving Gizmo nodes in Nuke. By reducing manual effort, the tool enforces consistency in naming conventions, streamlines version control, and enhances collaboration by incorporating essential metadata such as author, department, and version details.

## Key Benefits  
- **Consistency:** Ensures uniform naming and metadata standards across all Gizmos.  
- **Time-Saving:** Automates repetitive tasks to improve efficiency and productivity.  
- **Version Control:** Provides structured tracking of major and minor updates for clear versioning.  
- **Metadata Management:** Allows the inclusion of author, department, and description information for better organization and transparency.  
- **Error Handling:** Alerts users for duplicate file names and provides options for saving incremental versions.

## How It Works  
1. **Input Details:** Enter required details such as author name, department, Gizmo name, version, and description in the provided fields.  
2. **Set Save Location:** Specify the folder path where the Gizmo file will be saved.  
3. **Handle Duplicates:** If a file with the same name already exists, the tool prompts users to either create a new major or minor version.  
4. **Save Gizmo:** Save the file with the specified naming convention and associated metadata.  
5. **Confirmation:** A success message confirms the creation of the Gizmo. For duplicate files, users are notified of the incremental updates made.
